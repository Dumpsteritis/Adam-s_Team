I could not believe this happened to Steve Harvey. Usually, I don't experiencce prompter issues but hey, it's a new show and new woman. I'll be getting the commands from the prompter in front so no need to read card now. The moral to the story is don't believe anything can't happen to just you. Hey

I could not believe this happened to me rigbht off the bat. Usually, I don't experiencce install issues but hey, it's a new class and new software. I'll be getting the commands from the instructor in Slack so no need to document now. The moral to the story is don't believe anything can't happen to just you.  It is happening to all of us.

My name is Huy
And this is my story.. njoy

I play soccer for 20 years then one day I got sick and had to miss a game.  My coach cut me and now I have to become a computer engineer which is what 
my father intented for me.  On the drive home from getting cut, I was miserable...

My favorite food is chicken and pasta... but bacon is great too.  Growing up on a farm, I loved many of the farm animals and I felt bad slaughtering them.  Luckily, they were tasty.

My name is Craig Schultz.  I am currently going to devCodeCamp in order to change careers.  I have been in the IT support industry for roughly 15 years.  While I have had some good jobs and have worked for some good companies, I haven't been getting the satisfaction out of the work that I use to.  There are other reasons for this change as well; better opportunities, better pay, and a real sense of contributing to a business.
