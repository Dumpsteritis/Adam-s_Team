I could not believe this happened to Steve Harvey. Usually, I don't experiencce prompter issues but hey, it's a new show and new woman. I'll be getting the commands from the prompter in front so no need to read card now. The moral to the story is don't believe anything can't happen to just you. Last week Steve read the verdict for Steven Avery, "Account of reckless Homicide... not guilty". After a short break he came back, "my fault everyone, I just glanced at the card and misread it, Steves guilty". Paul finally got this. He really did.

I could not believe this happened to me rigbht off the bat. Usually, I don't experiencce install issues but hey, it's a new class and new software. I'll be getting the commands from the instructor in Slack so no need to document now. The moral to the story is don't believe anything can't happen to just you.  It is happening to all of us.

Steve Harvey made me lose my job
