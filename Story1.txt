I could not believe this happened to me right off the bat. Usually, I don't experience intall issues but hey, it's a new class and new software. I'll be getting the commands from the instructor in Slack so no need to document now. The moral to the story is don't believe anything can't happen to just you.

Thankfully, there are other people in the same boat as I am. You can't be afraid to ask questions even if it puts you a little farther behind. Everyone has been very helpful with instructions and getting through tasks.
